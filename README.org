- ✅ Visually Compact
- ✅ Information Dense
- ✅ Aesthetically Pleasing

This doom modeline segment shows the number of lines deleted and added to the current file. Click it to stage and commit the changes. It's asynchronous and highly configurable.

One changed line would show one deletion and one addition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/01.svg
(beep-boop
 '(:staged-removed 1
   :staged-added 1))
#+end_src

[[file:./assets/01.svg]]

By default, the modeline segment shows only one character for every ten lines changed. e.g. 33 lines deleted and 66 added would look like this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/02.svg
(beep-boop
 '(:staged-removed 33
   :staged-added 66))
#+end_src

[[file:./assets/02.svg]]

By default, when there would be more than ten characters, the modeline segment uses numbers instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/03.svg
(beep-boop
 '(:staged-removed 44
   :staged-added 66))
#+end_src

[[file:./assets/03.svg]]

It also gracfully handles lots of changes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/04.svg
(beep-boop
 '(:staged-removed 2123
   :staged-added 3917654))
#+end_src

* Features

- *Asynchronous Updates*: Fetches Git information in the background.
- *Smart Display*: Automatically switches between two display modes:
  - *Symbols* ([[file:assets/05.svg]]): For a quick visual summary of small (less that 100) lines changed.
  - *Human-Readable* ([[file:assets/06.svg]]): For a compact numerical summary of large changes.
- *Staged vs. Unstaged*: Staged vs unstaged use different faces.
- *Clickable*: Clicking the segment runs ~magit-diff-buffer-file~ to show the current diff and let you stage and commit the file.
- *Customizable*: Control the characters, colors, display thresholds, and symbol density to your liking.

* Installation

Add the following to your ~$DOOMDIR/packages.el~. The ~:recipe~ tells Doom how to fetch the package directly from GitHub.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :eval no
    (package! modeline-vcs-diffstat
      :recipe (:host github
               :repo "rgkirch/modeline-vcs-diffstat"))
    #+END_SRC

Ensure ~modeline-vcs-diffstat.el~ is on your ~load-path~ and add it to your ~doom-modeline~ configuration.

Example using ~use-package~:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :eval no
(use-package doom-modeline
  :ensure t
  :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  :config
  (require 'modeline-vcs-diffstat)
  (doom-modeline-def-modeline 'main
    '(bar window-state vcs modeline-vcs-diffstat buffer-info)
    '(misc-info persp-name selection-info)))
#+END_SRC

* Customization
You can customize the segment's behavior using ~M-x customize-group RET modeline-vcs-diffstat RET~.

** Change the threshold for switching to number display

Set ~modeline-vcs-diffstat-display-methods~ to switch from symbols to numbers after 50 total changes instead of the default 100.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/07.svg
(beep-boop
 '(:staged-removed 25
   :staged-added 25))
#+end_src

[[file:./assets/07.svg]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/08.svg
(let ((modeline-vcs-diffstat-display-methods
       `((50 . ,#'modeline-vcs-diffstat--metrics-numeric-pstring)
         (1 . ,#'modeline-vcs-diffstat--symbol-pstring))))
  (beep-boop
   '(:staged-removed 25
     :staged-added 25)))
#+end_src

[[file:./assets/08.svg]]


** Use ~x~ symbols for ~y~ lines changed

By default, one symbol represents ~10 lines. To make it one symbol per 5 lines, you can change ~modeline-vcs-diffstat-count-function~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/09.svg
(beep-boop
 '(:staged-removed 25
   :staged-added 25))
#+end_src

[[file:./assets/09.svg]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results file :file ./assets/10.svg
(let ((modeline-vcs-diffstat-count-function
      (lambda (lines)
        (ceiling (/ (float lines) 5.0)))))
  (beep-boop
   '(:staged-removed 25
     :staged-added 25)))
#+end_src

[[file:./assets/10.svg]]
